Shape Recognition ApplicationOverviewAn interactive MATLAB-based computer vision application designed to detect and classify geometric shapes within digital images using Image Processing.Multi-Shape Detection: Automatically detects all shapes in an image once the button is pressed.Advanced Processing: Includes Adaptive Thresholding, Canny/Sobel Edge Detection, and Watershed segmentation to handle touching objects.Visualization Suite: Toggle contours, bounding boxes, centroids, and color-coded labels.Detection ParametersMethodBest ForDescriptionAdaptiveUneven lightingBest for images with shadows.GlobalHigh-contrastBest for perfectly lit scans.Edge DetectionOutlinesBest for shapes that are outlines rather than fills.How to RunType ShapeRecognitionApp in the MATLAB Command Window or run directly on MATLAB online.Click Load Image to import a source file (.jpg, .png, .bmp, .tiff).Adjust Threshold and Area sliders to fine-tune detection based on image quality.Click Detect Shapes to run the analysis and visualize results.Report📄 See User_Guide.pdf and README.pdf for the full technical breakdown and logic.
