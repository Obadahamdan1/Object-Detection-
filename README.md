Shape Recognition App (MATLAB Computer Vision Project)

## Overview
This project is an interactive MATLAB-based computer vision application for detecting
and classifying geometric shapes in digital images using image processing techniques.

The app allows users to load images, configure preprocessing parameters, and visualize
detected shapes with multiple overlays.

## Key Features
1. Multi-shape detection (circles, stars, polygons, etc.)
2. Adaptive & global thresholding
3. Edge-based detection for outline shapes
4. Watershed segmentation for touching objects
5. Interactive visualization with contours, bounding boxes, and labels

## Project Structure
- Preprocessing & Noise Reduction
- Image Segmentation (Adaptive / Global Threshold / Edge Detection)
- Feature Extraction (Area, Circularity, Solidity, etc.)
- Rule-based Shape Classification
- Interactive Visualization & Export

## How to Run
1. Ensure MATLAB path includes the project folder
2. Run:
